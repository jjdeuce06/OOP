# OOP
Code from Object-Oriented Programing Course in Fall 2023
These are all files from completed assignments in the OOP course of Fall 2023
Assignment 1 includes maincpp, customer.h, and customer.cpp
The purpose of Assignment 1 was to read a file in format:
First name
Last Name
Old meter
New meter
To calculate an electric bill
With no errors, these new record are placed in a file called output.txt in format:
Last name, first name    bill
When an error was detected, which in this case was nothing in the name space or a meter reading over 9999, it was placed in an error file in the same format as it was read
